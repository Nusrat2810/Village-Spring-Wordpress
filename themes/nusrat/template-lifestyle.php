                    <p>A large, open Central Green lawn will be a focal point for the arrival into the southeast neighborhood, as well as create a destination within the community.

An open lawn provides for a range of opportunities from informal and formal events to casual sporting gatherings, as well as providing a visual green space for a large number of outward residential views.</p>

                    <p>An extensive trail network will link the sidewalk system with the surrounding natural features of the community.

                    <p>Seating areas and widened trail sections may be provided at specific waypoints where there are spectacular viewsheds or potential activity areas. While the majority of the trail will be constructed of asphalt, select areas that encroach steeper slopes or run adjacent to a pond may employ a short section of boardwalk to minimize disturbance.</p>
                    <p>The boardwalk sections may be constructed of composite wood to reduce future maintenance costs. Trail head markers may be provided at main entrance points and will include a general map and directional cues for the various activity areas.</p>
                    <p>At intermittent points along the trail, there may be fitness stations for exercise enthusiasts, educational signage for wildlife lovers, interpretative signage describing some of the historic events and/or landmarks, and interactive music play stations for children.</p>
